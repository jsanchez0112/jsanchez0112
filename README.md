ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jacob!

Welcome to my Github.

I am currently a aspriring Software Engineer attending General Assembly with a completion date of July 20th, 2022. I recently took on the challenge to learn how to code after a successful career in Technology Sales/Consulting. I realized that I liked the technical side of things more than I did the selling of it so I made the natural progression over to pursue it. My technical experience includes designing networks, systems, recreating processes, and changing critical operations. At the completion of my bootcamp I will add HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Ajax, and more to my list of skills. My personal Github will be updated almost daily with projects that are personal or required by GA. Feel free to reach out to me via email at edsaja12@gmail.com or phone at 210-792-9225. 

Project 1 will be completed May 12th, 2022. This is my first attempt at a solo project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Ajax. 

I encourage you to check in periodically to this page to see what I am working on and as I get more familiar with Github, this AboutMe will change and be updated.
